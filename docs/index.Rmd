# Part 2: Creating a Website {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

*************

## Introduction

Even until a couple of years ago, creating a website along with a blog that embeded both code and text, required specific knowledge of `HTML`. Tools such as [`markdown`](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), have abstracted the difficult part of writing `HTML` code for us, so that we can focus on content and creating reproducible analyses. Building on these very tools, the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package by [`Yihue Xie`](https://yihui.name/) has made it that much easier to create websites that allow you to showcase your scripts, code and reports, while also maintaining a public portfolio, i.e., **having an online presence**.  


In this part, we will create a minimal working example of a [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) website. I have provided detailed screenshots with annotations of each step. In general a red encircled annotation means you should click on it, and a red rectangular annotation means that you should verify or be aware of this. _Note: the screenshots provided here are from a Linux operating system, however it will be similar on a Windows or Mac._  


<br>


## Step 1: Create 2 git repos

We first need to create two GitHub repositories (abbreviated as repo). One will hold the source code for your website, and the other will host the compiled `HTML` files which make up your website (these are often referred to as static files). Head over to your GitHub account online and create a new repository:

*************

<br>

Give it a name. It can be anything you want such as `website`, `website_source`, `source` (just pick a name that will remind you that this repository contains the source files of your website). In the screenshots below I used `website` throughout. Check the box to initialize the repository with a README and then click on `Create repository`:

# Code and tables

## Syntax highlighting

Here is a sample code chunk, just to show that syntax highlighting works as expected.

```{r sh, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

not_null <- function (v) {
  if (!is.null(v)) return(paste(v, "not null"))
}

data(iris)
tab <- iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length),
            Sepal.Width  = mean(Sepal.Width),
            Petal.Length = mean(Petal.Length),
            Petal.Width  = mean(Petal.Length))
```


## Verbatim

Here is the structure of the `iris` dataset.

```{r iris_str, echo=TRUE}
str(iris)
```

## Table

Here is a sample table output.

```{r iris_table}

kable(tab)

```

Here we display a crosstab displayed in several different ways with a "pills"
interface. To do this, just pass your `table()` result to the `pilltabs()`
function.

```{r iris_pilltabs, results="asis"}

iris$seplc <- cut(iris$Sepal.Length,3)
tab <- table(iris$Species, iris$seplc)
pilltabs(tab)

```


# Figures

Here is an histogram.

```{r iris_hist}
ggplot(data=iris) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x=Petal.Width)) +
    facet_grid(Species~.)

```

And a wonderful scatterplot, with a caption.

```{r iris_scatter1, fig.cap="This is a caption"}
ggplot(data=iris) + geom_point(aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length, color=Species))
```

# Mathjax

And finally, an incredibly complex equation :

$$ y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{x}} $$
